# Multivariate-Analysis
We perform multivariate analysis on the Egyptian skull data to ascertain whether or not the dimensions of the skulls changed over the different time periods. Assumptions of MANOVA were checked and MANOVA was performed. We also performed Box's M test, Shapiro's multivariate normality test, some descriptive statistics and visualizations.
